# This repository lives on Azure Repos and is checked out as a submodule of
# the-test-cabinet. GitHub holds a copy under the same name, so a clone of the
# superproject's GitHub mirror resolves the submodule's relative URL there.
# Nothing else pushes to the mirror, which is why the push is forced: the mirror
# follows Azure, whatever it held before.
#
# <key-file> is the private half of a deploy key with write access to the
# mirror, which the pipeline keeps as a secure file. The checkout must hold the
# full history, because GitHub refuses a push from a shallow clone.
